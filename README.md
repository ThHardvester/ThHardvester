Self-taught Software Engineer with 2 years of experience in IT, driven by curiosity and continuous learning.
My focus is on offensive cybersecurity, vulnerability research, and malware analysis, combining cloud knowledge, web development background, and ethical hacking methodologies.

I actively study real-world attack techniques to better understand how systems fail — and how they can be secured.
